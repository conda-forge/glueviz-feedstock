# NOTE: this is a meta-package that includes the core glue code as well as stable
# plugins. This is the main conda package we want in the Navigator, so we add the
# app: entry here and not in the glue-core package. Even though glueviz is a
# Python package on PyPI, and has a setup.py file, we don't include a build command
# below since the only purpose of that command is to trigger the installation of the
# dependencies.
